description:This is an Ecwid app.
It's opened from Ecwid admin https://my.ecwid.com/store/<store_id>#app:name=<app_name>
Ecwid opens an iframe with my app which is located under https://ec.1nax.app
For development I use onrender to host https://ec.1nax.app, which redirects to my Ngrok tunnel https://vigorously-loving-pug.ngrok-free.app/
The onrender host just redirects requests.
